To help patients manage their health better, they were looking to use Health Harmony but found the product too expensive. <p> <p>Currently, we set up vital sign monitors with iPads and ship everything to new patients. When patients get our devices, everything is configured for them. While this may be an easy to use solution, doctors wanted a more affordable solution.</p><p>To reduce the price, we can let patients use Health Harmony with their own devices – all mobile devices, laptops and desktops and their own vital sign monitors. To accomplish the goal, we have to re-design the application to fit and work seamlessly with all devices.</p><h3>REVIEWS</h3><ul> <li> Existing Application </li><li> Existing User Experience </li><li> Medical Conditions </li></ul> <h3>STAKEHOLDER MAP</h3> <h4>CLINIC</h4> <ul> <li>Nurses</li><li>Medical Assistants</li><li>Doctors</li></ul> <h4>HOME</h4> <ul> <li>Patients</li><li>Caregivers</li><li>Family&Friends </li></ul> </div><h3>FIELD ANALYSIS</h3> <p> Observations </p><h3>TECH CAPACITY</h3> <p>We assume that our internal team will handle the development. Our lead developer is researching what tech stack would be the best for all platforms. Since I need to make changes to my prototypes quickly, my challenge would be to learn about the chosen tech stack quickly. </p><h3>COMPETITIVE OVERVIEW</h3> <p>I reviewed about 15 apps with similar services; none of them offer the exact service that we do. I’m still reviewing some of them. I'll keep details of the findings for our internal communications, but I concluded that we need to offer more for less, along with a superior design. And that would be one more challenge for us. </p><h3>DEFINE</h3> <h4 class="subheading">Design Strategy and Focus</h4> </div><p>During this phase, I had to make sense of our user research.

So Ms. Suki and Dr. Wu agreed to openly tell the company about their current needs. </div></br> <div class="testimonial-section"> It was not the first time that the company heard about the same kind of demands, so they decided to re-design the product. </div></div></div></div></div></div></section> <h3>IDEATE</h3> <h4 class="subheading">Explore Many Options</h4> <p>After we agreed on the scope and limitations, ideation was done in two stages. First, I needed to come up with the user flow for patients entering their vital sign measurements. And then, I proceeded with the user flow for health sessions.</p><h3>Scope</h3> <p>Enable users to only enter measurements and complete health sessions without connecting devices for them. Prepare the application so users can connect their own vital sign monitors at home. <p> <h3>Sketching</h3> <p>During this phase, I tried to capture my frantic thinking with quick sketching.</p></div><h3>DECIDE</h3> <h4 class="subheading">Choose What to Focus on</h4> <p>The team agreed about both user flows, but I realized, during this wireframing stage, that we needed help from our clinical team for health sessions. We needed to incorporate education with the user daily tasks, and we also needed to interpret vital sign measurements for patients.</p></p><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/53a974bc-7451-4f28-7b63-21f20fbb26f2-2598/">WIREFRAME</a> <h3>PROTOTYPE</h3> <h4 class="subheading">Low to High Fidelity Visuals</h4> <p>This is my second prototype and I have a long way to go. I use Adobe XD now, and it lets me incorporate limited interactions with my prototypes. Both user flows are incorporated. We now need to wait for someone with the medical knowledge to help with further interactions. </p><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/c6889e3d-fe2c-4882-9cfa-cc1c88f6ce61/">PROTOTYPE</a> <section class="list section "> <div class="section-inner"> <div class="text-center"><a href="how"><h3>MORE DESIGN THINKING...</h3>ChildSafe</h3></a> </div></section> <section class="list section"> <nav aria-label="..."> <ul class="pager inline"> <li class="previous"> <a href="design_thinking"> My Process</a> </li><li class="next"> <a href="workhistory">Experience </a> </li></ul> </nav> </section> <div class="footer-border"/> <footer class="footer col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-center"> <div class="container"> <div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-4 col-md-4 col-md-offset-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-center"> <p class="copyright">Designed and developed by Tanja Medic. </p><p class="copyright"> <a href="sitemap">Sitemap</a> </p></div></div></footer> <script type="text/javascript " src="assets/js/combined.js "></script> <script type="text/javascript " src="assets/js/creative.js "></script> <script type="text/javascript " src="assets/js/main.js "></script> <script>/*=======Defer Image Loading *=======*/ function init(){var imgDefer=document.getElementsByTagName('img'); for (var i=0; i < imgDefer.length; i++){if (imgDefer[i].getAttribute('data-src')){imgDefer[i].setAttribute('src', imgDefer[i].getAttribute('data-src'));}}}window.onload=init; </script> </div></body></html>
