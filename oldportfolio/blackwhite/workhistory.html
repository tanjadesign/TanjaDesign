That's why I listened when emergency managers consistently complained about emergency plans.</p><h3 class="modal-title title" id="firstModalLabel">Problem 1</h3> <p>According to the law, kindergartens have to submit emergency plans to the emergency management. They would send them by mail, or deliver them in person. Sometimes their plans were handwritten.</p><p>But the intent of the law - to help kindergartens better prepare for emergencies, better account for children’s safety, and better communicate with the local emergency management agency - was not fulfilled.</p><h3 class="modal-title title" id="firstModalLabel">Problem 2</h3> <p>The local agency was obliged to accept the plans and store them in an archive. However, they couldn’t use the details when they deploy during emergencies, and having access to these details can make a difference between life and death.</p><p>Their frustration was also tied to their inability to purse their larger strategic goal. During disasters, the agency is supposed to help with coordinating efforts on the ground and that includes providing accurate information to first responders.</p><p>For instance, if we have an emergency in the zip codes 40205 and 40207, knowing emergency details would help with deciding what kind of resources are needed on the ground - ambulances, fire trucks, people, etc. It could also help with planning for future emergencies.</p><h3 class="modal-title title" id="firstModalLabel">Problem 3</h3> <p>State administrators also had a problem on their hands. In order to issue kindergarten licenses, child care administrators had to check if kindergartens complied with the law. To accomplish that, they had to come to the archive room and sift through emergency plans. This was not their only responsibility. It was one of many. </p><h3 class="modal-title title" id="firstModalLabel">Problems Solved</h3> <p>So this simple application was a win-win for everyone involved. </p><p>Kindergartens and preschools can now create and make changes to their emergency plans whenever they want. They are not tied to any place, time, or a particular device.</p><p>Emergency managers can view information that can help with preventing injuries, saving lives and reuniting parents with their children. They can do that quickly and easily. They are also not tied to any place, time or a device.</p><p>State administrators can easily check if kindergartens comply with the law, and concentrate on much more important business.</p><p>Parents can also easily get the copies of emergency plans whenever they ask for it.</p><h3 class="modal-title title" id="firstModalLabel">Lesson</h3> <p>As they say, it's not what you know, but what you do with what you know.</p><p>In this case, users didn’t have to deal with cumbersome technology that causes frustration and anxiety. I knew I didn’t have any control over distractions in their work environment. I knew I couldn’t reduce the level of their work related stress. But I did everything I could to make their experience seamless and worthwhile.</p><p>In this case, I didn't worry about compliance; I worried about the outcome. That's how human-centered design looks like when applied to real problems. That's how essentially technology should be used - to solve problems, help users accomplish their tasks and get the outcome they need.</p><p>It is not invented, so that designers, developers and IT people can put themselves on a pedestal and bore and intimidate users with their IT jargon.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg closebtn" data-dismiss="modal"> <i class="fa fa-times fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> Close</a> </div></div></div></div><div class="modal fade" id="sixModal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="sixModalLabel" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog" role="document"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-body-two"> <button type="button" class="close " data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"> <i class="fa fa-times-circle fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i> </button> <h3 class="modal-title two" id="sixModalLabel">ChildSafe Workflow</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> <blockquote class="quote">Recognized the problem and initiated a solution; performed the initial research; identified relevant stakeholders, user groups and business needs.</blockquote> </li><li> <blockquote class="quote">Collaborated with an emergency plan coordinator, ChildCare Aware, and the Division of Regulated Child Care when collecting requirements and implementing the solution.</blockquote> </li><li> <blockquote class="quote">Identified technology constraints; researched available development tools with special regard to security and data protection.</blockquote> </li><li> <blockquote class="quote">Pitched the idea to the higher-ups to get the approval and funding for the development tools.</blockquote> </li><li> <blockquote class="quote">Defined the scope, strategy, focus and user testing methods; proceeded with collecting information, planning and development.</blockquote> </li><li> <blockquote class="quote">Designed the user workflow and information architecture, performed user testing and created an optimal user experience for mobile, tablet and desktop devices before going public.</blockquote> </li><li> <blockquote class="quote">Developed a promo Web site to urge childcare providers to sign up and submit emergency plans.</blockquote> </li><li> <blockquote class="quote">Led user onboarding sessions.</blockquote> </li><li> <blockquote class="quote">Made final changes so that users can take the full ownership of the application and make easy changes to their user accounts.</blockquote> </li></ul> </div><div class="modal-footer two"> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg closebtn" data-dismiss="modal"> <i class="fa fa-times fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> Close</a> </div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"> <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingTwo"> <h4 class="panel-title"> <a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">ENews <i class="more-less fa fa-plus"></i> </a> </h4> </div><div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingTwo"> <div class="panel-body"> <div class="panel-content"> <p> <span class="highlight">D</span>esigned and developed two responsive e-newsletter templates.

Since I made the initiative, I had to suck it up and come up with new content every month.</p><p>Why? I thought it was important.</p><p>It is too late to offer safety tips during disasters. It seems irrelevant and cruel to offer safety tips after the disaster strikes, especially to people who are directly affected by it. And during training sessions, people get overwhelmed with too much information.</p><p>It sucked that no one really promoted the safety tips, and I never had a chance to do so. I also never had a chance to brainstorm about the content.</p><p>Here is one of the UX nuggets. Sometimes, stakeholders won’t tell you what they need. And reviewing tech and business needs won’t help you get to the heart of the issue.</p><p>When I created templates, I thought that we were facing tech constraints.

So when all hell breaks loose, everyone involved with emergency operations would log in and learn what is happening on the ground and what is needed.</p><p>It was also touted as a platform that would help administrators build customized interfaces on the fly during emergencies. When I took over, it was just a huge mess. It had no purpose and structure. Period.</p><h3 class="modal-title title" id="thirdModalLabel">PROBLEMS</h3> <p>There were too many problems with the system, and I’ll just cite a few of them to shorten the story.</p><p>The system had 70 users, most of them sleepers, a few of them active. The system should only be used during big emergencies, but it was still worrisome that so many people didn’t sign up.</p><p>Horrible, horrible, horrible interface. I’ll spare you the details. I had never seen anything like it in my entire life. If I do see it in future, I’ll run away pronto <i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> But you gather by now, that it was no accident that the system had only few users.</p><p>Bad programming. Jumpy interfaces. Unpredictable actions. Unnecessary JavaScript in the background. HTML was old. How old? Who knows? Some well known HTML tags such as links and buttons disabled, and replaced with proprietary tags. Inline CSS used on any page and throughout the system. Some JavaScript functions disabled; replaced with proprietary functions. No documentation and resources for proprietary tags. Too many pages. Too much code. That would all be OK, if the system had any development environment built into it. It didn’t. And I couldn’t copy the code files and build and test in a native environment too. So I had set my self with a nice never ending job <i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> </p><h3 class="modal-title title" id="thirdModalLabel">SOLUTION</h3> <p>How did I solve all of that? By following the IT mantra - plan, design, build and test. And by pushing the walls. That’s how I felt most of the time, while trying to work through the issues.</p><p>The first hurdle was the hardest. I needed to find out about the structure of the system, its intended use, and users. The fog didn’t clear after reading their documents; they were intended for the outsiders. They didn’t explain about tasks needed to be accomplished during emergencies.</p><p>The fog didn’t clear after talking to vendors, IT people, emergency management and a whole bunch of other people.</p><p>So I gave the owners of the system two choices: either to stick with what the WebEOC vendor came up, or to customize the system based on their needs. In case they decided to proceed with the second choice - customization - they needed to be specific about their tasks and their needs. They chose to go with the vendor’s version, and agreed it was their job to explain about emergency operations to users.</p><p>I decided about the structure and design, and proceeded with building it, page by page. This involved hours and hours of work, cleaning and deciding what to keep, or fix. I swear after so many hours of sifting through the code, I forgot to talk. In any language.</p><p>In the end, the system was in a much better shape than before. It had clean, simple, and functional interfaces, and clear purpose.</p><p>The system gained new users. The number climbed to about 400 users.</p><p>However, the system still relied on a faulty WebEOC framework and that pretty much tied my hands. I was very disappointed with the result of my hard work. Considering the time and effort I put in it, I realized, I could have developed a better and much more useful system on my own, even if I had started with a blank page. And no one does that these days. Everyone tries to speed up through their development phase and automate as many tasks as possible.</p><h3 class="modal-title title" id="thirdModalLabel">Lesson</h3> <p>Don’t try to put a lipstick on a pig. You’re still going to end up with a big, fat, and ugly pig. Put your users first, figure out what they want, and figure out how you’re going to accomplish your goal. In the end, it will all serve a purpose no matter what kind of obstacles you come across.</p><p>Also, don’t pay attention to naysayers. Ever. If you try to prove them wrong, you may end up doing what you didn’t want in the first place.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg closebtn" data-dismiss="modal"> <i class="fa fa-times fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> Close</a> </div></div></div></div></div><div class="modal fade" id="eightModal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="eightModalLabel" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog" role="document"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-body-two"> <button type="button" class="close " data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"> <i class="fa fa-times-circle fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i> </button> <h3 class="modal-title two" id="eightModalLabel">WebEOC Workflow</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> <blockquote class="quote">Defined needs, benefits, technical analysis and design of a crisis management system.</blockquote> </li><li> <blockquote class="quote">Gathered and reviewed business requirements with users; discussed and analyzed problems users have with the production system; developed solutions, tested, and documented changes.</blockquote> </li><li> <blockquote class="quote">Designed and developed new system interfaces; created user guides; defined the sign up process.</blockquote> </li><li> <blockquote class="quote">Cooperated with vendors, IT services and other stakeholders to ensure usability and functionality.</blockquote> </li><li> <blockquote class="quote">Administered the emergency management system and provided user support.</blockquote> </li></ul> </div><div class="modal-footer two"> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg closebtn" data-dismiss="modal"> <i class="fa fa-times fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> Close</a> </div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"> <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingFour"> <h4 class="panel-title"> <a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFour">SharePoint <span class="more-less fa fa-plus"></span> </a> </h4> </div><div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingFour"> <div class="panel-body"> <div class="panel-content"> <p> <span class="highlight">D</span>eveloped two SharePoint applications for the quality assurance team and four types of users: performance reviewers, dispatchers and call takers, supervisors, and management.</p><div class="text-center"> <a class="btn btn-info btn-lg" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#fourthModal"> <span class="fa fa-rocket fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></span> the story</a> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#nineModal"> <span class="fa fa-rocket fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></span> workflow</a> </div><div class="modal fade" id="fourthModal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="fourthModalLabel" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog" role="document"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-body"> <button type="button" class="close " data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"> <i class="fa fa-times-circle fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i> </button> <h3 class="modal-title title" id="fourthModalLabel">PROBLEM</h3> <p>The quality assurance team had full hands with training employees, and monitoring the performance of 911 call takers and dispatchers.
