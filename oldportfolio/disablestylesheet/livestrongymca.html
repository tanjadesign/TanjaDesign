I completed a short heuristic analysis of existing Web sites after reviewing guidelines for landing and donation pages. I also observed a lot. Take a look at what I found out.</p><h4>PROBLEM 1</h4> <p>Livestrong at the YMCA helps cancer patients who suffer from the disease, chemotherapy and other treatments.</p><p>When they join, a personal trainer first meets with the patients to assess their overall health and their primary goals. Then, the trainer develops a fitness program for each person. Their membership is free for 12 weeks. </p><p>Free programs like this depend from individual donations, and the YMCA as a whole doesn’t share its donations. Each facility has to conduct a separate fundraising campaign. The Southeast YMCA facility has a problem because they operate in a diverse, but lower income Buechel neighborhood. That’s why this branch has to develop a new and successful fundraising strategy. </p><h4>PROBLEM 2</h4> <p>Safety around Water program teaches unprivileged children how to survive in water for free. When they join, a swimming instructor determines their swimming levels, and then develop a program that would help them learn survival skills no matter how they end up in water. </p><p>This year, the Southeast facility taught survival water skills to 1000 children. The facility offers these essential classes to all children in the West End for free. </p><p>Just like Livestrong, Safety around Water also depends from individual donations. The latest research revealed one more problem for YMCA Southeast. Donors like to contribute to multiple organizations but demand for greater transparency and accountability. That wouldn’t be a problem if people knew about the YMCA free programs and their benefits to the community. But it turns out, they don’t. </p><h3>USABILITY GUIDELINES FOR LANDING PAGES</h3> <p>Take a look at my blog post to learn about landing page guidelines. </p><p> <a href="blog#landingguide" target="_blank">Read </a> </p><h3>USABILITY GUIDELINES FOR DONATION PAGES</h3> <p>Here you can find what works and what doesn't work for donation pages. </p><p> <a href="blog#donationsguide" target="_blank">Read </a> </p><h3>REVIEWS</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled col-md-12"> <li> Existing Livestrong Web Site </li><li> Existing Donations Print Page </li></ul> <h3>SHORT HEURESTIC ANALYSIS</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled col-md-12"> <li> Existing YMCA Web Site </li><li> Existing Donations Online Page </li></ul> <h3>STAKEHOLDER MAP</h3> <div class="col-md-12"> <div class="panel panel-primary"> <div class="panel-heading"> <h4 class="panel-title">YMCA</h4></div><ul class="panel-body"> <li>Healthy Living Coordinator</li><li>Aquatics Director</li><li>Director</li></ul> </div></div><div class="col-md-12"> <div class="panel panel-primary"> <div class="panel-heading"> <h4 class="panel-title">CANCER PATIENTS</h4> </div><ul class="panel-body"> <li>Livestrong Members</li><li>Prospective Members</li><li>Oncologists and nurses</li><li>Family and Friends</li></ul> </div></div><div class="col-md-12"> <div class="panel panel-primary"> <div class="panel-heading"> <h4 class="panel-title">DONORS</h4> </div><div class="panel-body"> <p>Entire public</p></div></div></div><h3>USER NEEDS</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled col-md-12"> <li> Interviews </li><li> Focus groups </li><li> Surveys </li></ul> <h3>FIELD ANALYSIS</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled col-md-12"> <li> Ethnographic observations </li><li> Contextual observations </li></ul> <h3>TECH CAPACITY</h3> <p>Our volunteer will design and develop a responsive landing page and then implement the CMS with the page. We don't anticipate any unusual difficulties with the technical work. </p><p>She will also come up with a newsletter template for fundraising and start a Facebook page for Livestrong members.</p><h3>COMPETITIVE OVERVIEW</h3> <p>I kind of got stuck with this one. I haven’t found any free swimming or water safety classes , especially not for the children of West End. However, I found a lot of free classes offered to cancer patients.</p><p>How do you decide if any of them compare to Livestrong at the YMCA? So for now, we’re going to stop with competitive analysis. We are going to assume that we compete with many local non-profits even though they don’t offer the same services. However, we compete for the same amount of donations money. </p></div><h3>DEFINE</h3> <h4 class="subheading">Design Strategy and Focus</h4> </div><div class="timeline-body"> <p>My design strategy for the landing page is coming up slowly. I know who my main users are, and how I want them to feel about the landing page for fundraising.</p></div><h3>User Experience</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> Donors </li><li> Fundraisers </li></ul> <h3>Design Principles</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> Persuasive </li><li> Respectable </li><li> Honest </li><li> Useful </li></ul> <section class="list section" id="healthylivingpersona"> <div class="section-inner"> <div class="content"> <div class="item row"> <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> <h2 class="heading">Persona</h2> <div class="thumbnail-new"> <div class="item"> <h4 class="title">HEALTHY LIVING COORDINATOR</h4> </div><h2>Stacey Pollack</h2> <p>Stacey Pollack loves her job, even though she works in a hectic environment. Her attention shifts from the gym members and equipment malfunctions to the personal trainers she supervises and the fundraising campaign.</p><p>She knows that her job is important.</p><p>“We have nothing, if we don’t have health,” Stacey said.</p><h3>PROBLEM</h3> <p>There is one program that holds the special meaning for Stacey - Livestrong at the YMCA.</p><p>When her stepfather Charlie was diagnosed with brain cancer, she felt helpless. Her stepfather died from the disease, which left her heartbroken.</p><p>That’s why she now takes time to help cancer patients who suffer from the disease, chemotherapy and other treatments. After 25 years as a personal trainer and physical therapy education, this is how she can contribute the most - motivate cancer patients and teach them how to build strength and battle fatigue.</p><p>And she noticed the difference she makes. The Livestrong members walked a little faster; smiled more and appeared more confident, she said.</p><p>When they join, she first meets with them to assess their overall health and their primary goals. Then, she develops a personal training program for each person. Their membership is free for 12 weeks. Most of them take advantage of the 12 weeks, but a quarter of them never finish due to health complications and job restrictions. </p><p>Free programs like this depend from individual donations, and the YMCA as a whole doesn’t share its donations. Each facility has to conduct a separate fundraising campaign. But there is a problem that this Southeast YMCA facility faces. They operate in a diverse, but lower income Buechel neighborhood, mostly populated by immigrants. Not a millionaire neighborhood like Brownsboro, says Stacey. That’s why this branch has to step up with its fundraising game this year.</p><h3>SOLUTION</h3> <p>Create a set of online material and engage in offline promotional activities in the community:</p><ul class="list-unstyled education"> <li class="item">Landing page</li><li class="item">E-Newsletter</li><li class="item">Facebook page</li><li class="item">Engage volunteers for community events</li></ul> <p>Assess your impact and figure out how to motivate former members, and maintain the communication with them.</p><h3>GOALS</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled education"> <li>Improve the physical strength of current Livestrong members</li><li>Improve their overall health</li><li>Motivate the Livestrong members to continue with exercise after their 12 week free of charge period</li><li>Attract more cancer patients to the program</li><li>Improve fundraising for the program </li></ul> </div><div class="skills aside section motivations" id="skills"> <h3>MOTIVATIONS</h3> <ul class="thumb skillset"> <div class="item"> <li class="level-title">HEALTH 80% <span class="level-label"></span> </li><div class="level-bar"> <div class="level-bar-inner" data-level="80%"> </div></div></div><div class="item"> <li class="level-title">COMMUNITY WELLBEING 50% <span class="level-label"></span> </li><div class="level-bar"> <div class="level-bar-inner" data-level="50%"> </div></div></div><div class="item"> <li class="level-title">MONEY 50% <span class="level-label" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" data-animation="true"></span> </li><div class="level-bar-striped active"> <div class="level-bar-inner" data-level="50%"> </div></div></div></ul> </div><div class="skills aside section motivations" id="skills"> <h3>TECH ATTITUDE</h3> <ul class="thumb skillset"> <div class="item"> <li class="level-title">TECH SAVVINESS 90% <span class="level-label"></span> </li><div class="level-bar"> <div class="level-bar-inner" data-level="90%"> </div></div></div><div class="item"> <li class="level-title">FRUSTRATION 5% <span class="level-label"></span> </li><div class="level-bar"> <div class="level-bar-inner" data-level="5%"> </div></div></div><div class="item"> <li class="level-title">USELESSNESS 90% <span class="level-label" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" data-animation="true"></span> </li><div class="level-bar-striped active"> <div class="level-bar-inner" data-level="90%"> </div></div></div></ul> </div></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 jobs section" id="jobs"> <h2 class="heading">Jobs to be done</h2> <div class="content"> <div class="item"> <blockquote class="quote"> <p>It would be great if more people hear about the program, so that we can raise more money this year. </p></blockquote> <blockquote class="source"> <span class="name">Healthy Living Coordinator</span> </blockquote> </div></div><div class="content"> <div class="item"> <blockquote class="quote"> <p>It would be great if our fundraising is successful this year, so that we can attract more cancer patients to the program. </p></blockquote> <blockquote class="source"> <span class="name">Healthy Living Coordinator</span> </blockquote> </div></div><div class="content"> <div class="item"> <blockquote class="quote"> <p>It would be great if more doctors and nurses recommended our program to their patients, so that we can help more cancer patients this year. </p></blockquote> <blockquote class="source"> <span class="name">Healthy Living Coordinator</span> </blockquote> </div></div><div class="content"> <div class="item"> <blockquote class="quote"> <p>It would be great if we could have another outlet, so that we can motivate our former members to stay on a healthy track. </p></blockquote> <blockquote class="source"> <span class="name">Healthy Living Coordinator</span> </blockquote> </div></div><div class="content"> <div class="item"> <blockquote class="quote"> <p>It would be great if our members had a chance to connect.</p></blockquote> <blockquote class="source"> <span class="name">Healthy Living Coordinator</span> </blockquote> </div></div></div></div></div></section> <section class="list section" id="livestrongpersona"> <div class="section-inner"> <div class="content"> <div class="item row"> <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> <h2 class="heading">Persona</h2> <div class="thumbnail-new"> <div class="item"> <h4 class="title pull-right">LIVESTRONG MEMBER</h4> </div><h2>Lydia Glogov</h2> <p>It’s been two months, since Lydia Glogov joined Livestrong at the YMCA.

Learn more serves users who want to find out more about the programs before investing their donation money.</p><p> Then we continue with WHY we exist - our members: cancer patients and underprivileged children. We also included our accomplishments before the call for action again. </p><p>On small mobile devices, we include the text area first, followed by the visuals on the second screen. Just like on large devices, we explain WHY we exist, and what we accomplished. Then we call for donations again. </p></div></div></div></div></div><h3 class="">DECIDE</h3> <h4 class="subheading">Choose What to Focus on</h4> </div><div class="timeline-body"> <p>These wireframes are based on the second idea I previously described.
