It was obvious that there was a valid business need for the online emergency plans. But two questions lingered. Why hasn't it been done before? And how can we accomplish our goals?</p><h3>PROBLEM 1</h3> <p>According to the law, kindergartens have to submit emergency plans to the emergency management. They would send them by mail, or deliver them in person. Sometimes their plans were handwritten.</p><p>But the intent of the law - to help kindergartens better prepare for emergencies, and better account for children’s safety - was not fulfilled.</p><h3>PROBLEM 2</h3> <p>The local emergency management agency was obliged to accept the plans and store them in an archive. However, they couldn’t use the details when they deploy during emergencies, and having access to these details can make a difference between life and death.</p><h3>PROBLEM 3</h3> <p>State administrators also had a problem on their hands. In order to issue kindergarten licenses, child care administrators had to check if kindergartens complied with the law. To accomplish that, they had to come to the archive room and sift through emergency plans. This was not their only responsibility. It was one of many. </p></div></div><h3>REVIEWS</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled col-md-6"> <li> Existing Docs </li><li> State Laws </li><li> FEMA Guidelines </li></ul> <h3>INTERVIEWS</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled col-md-6"> <li> Individual </li><li> Group </li><li> Experts </li></ul> <h2>STAKEHOLDER MAP</h2> <h3>KINDERGARTENS</h3> <ul class="panel-body"> <li>Teachers</li><li>Admins</li><li>Parents</li></ul> <h3>STATE</h3> <ul class="panel-body"> <li>ChildCare Aware</li><li>Division of Childcare</li><li>Leadership</li></ul> <h3>EMERGENCY SERVICES</h3> <ul class="panel-body"> <li>Emergency Management Agency</li><li>911</li><li>First Responders</li><li>311</li></ul> <h3>TECH CAPACITY</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> State Agencies </li><li> City Agencies </li><li> Digital Team </li></ul> <h3 class="modal-title title" id="twelveModalLabel">Field Analysis</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> Observations </li><li> Expert Insight </li><li> Knowledge </li></ul> <h3>Findings</h3> <p>The goal during this stage was to find out about user needs, behavior, work environments, and attitudes toward technology. <p> <p>My previous knowledge helped me with defining challenges of work in kindergartens, call centers, and the emergency management environment. I had to rely on first responder experts to find out about procedures, scenes and organization in their work environments. Interviews filled the gaps with everything else.</p><p>Competitive overview showed that no agency, state or local, was working on anything similar. </p><p>Our biggest obstacle was that we didn't have a development team on board, or development tools on disposal, and we needed to keep up with increased security and data protection guidelines.</p><h3>DEFINE</h3> <h4 class="subheading">Design Strategy and Focus</h4> <p>After I found the way to overcome our biggest obstacle, I started pouring all my user research into use cases, personas, jobs-to-be-done, and user journeys. My personas were goal oriented, but I accomplished a whole lot more with jobs-to-be-done.</p><h3>Limitations</h3> <p>Our biggest obstacle was that we didn't have a development team on board, or development tools on disposal, so the big portion of my time was spent on finding suitable development tools that would offer a secure storage and data encryption.</p><h3>Funding and a so called prototype</h3> <p>When I found the right solution, I signed up for a trial period. I managed to check the main capabilities, and then I set out to get the funding.</p><p> Instead of scheduling a meeting with all the people who decided about our budget, I managed to get a key support from one person, who checked my basic prototype and gave her input. She then won the support of other people, and I got the funding to proceed. My solution really saved the money and resources.</p><p>The first prototype included several screens that I printed out, according to the users' journeys. This pre-prototype was just used for this purpose, and kept as a reference. I didn't build upon it. </p><h3>User Experience</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> Kindergarten Users </li><li> Emergency Users </li><li> State Users </li></ul> <h3>Design Principles</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> Easy to use </li><li> Useful </li><li> Reassuring </li></ul> <h3>My launching tweet </h3> <p>Emergency plans now online - Sign Up, Sign In, Submit the Plan! It’s that easy! <p> <h2 class="heading">Persona</h2> <h4 class="title pull-right rose">HAZARDS SPECIALIST</h4> <h2 class="rose">Joshua Vanderhof</h2> <p>Joshua cares about his job, but he is greeted by the red tape wherever he turns.</p><p>“Look at this,” he says, while holding an emergency plan in his hand. “Can you read anything on it? Neither can I!”</p><h3>PROBLEMS</h3> <p>In this particular case, a kindergarten employee left an emergency plan at the reception. It was handwritten. Now Joshua needs to find their telephone number or an email address to let them know that the agency has the plan. When they ask for feedback, he can't give them any.</p><p>Joshua is buried with paperwork. He is on the tight deadlines with several grant proposals. In addition, he is working hard to update the new hazards mitigation plan. He attends the city-wide meetings, exercises, and evaluations. He collaborates with all the players - consultants, the representatives of city agencies, non-profits, the local university, etc.</p><p>In addition, he is not in the best shape of his life. After his heart bypass surgery, he needs to keep his stress level low, and adhere to strict diet guidelines.</p><p>“Man, I don’t have time for this,” he says, while walking hurriedly to the archive room to place the emergency plan in its appropriate place.</p><p>On the way there, he meets another employee, Karen and says: “Look what I got.”</p><p>“Another one,” Karen says. “But we can’t use any of it.”</p><p>Nothing in the plan is data sensitive, but everything can be used for operational services during disasters. It can help with search and rescue. It can help with emergency planning. It can help with mitigation.</p><h3>SOLUTION</h3> <p>Create a responsive online application for emergency plans. It should be accessible from all mobile devices and modern browsers.</p><p>“That would be wonderful,” says Joshua. “Don’t talk to me about Chrome or Firefox. I’ll do whatever you tell me to do. But it should be easy to use.

I knew where I was going. It was important to organize basic layouts and interactions. So I proceeded with sketching, and wireframes.</p><h3>DECIDE</h3> <h4 class="subheading">Choose What to Focus on</h4> <p>I made a decision based on the scope and user sceanarios. It was that simple.</p><h3>PROTOTYPE</h3> <h4 class="subheading">Low to High Fidelity Visuals</h4> <p>During this phase, I had to design each little detail and each little interaction. After developing a sufficient number of features for early adapters, I added more features based on user feedback. Everybody asks me how many prototypes I made. I don't remember. Why should I? I was busy getting things done.</p><p>While I don't remember how many prototypes I made, I remember major features I added based on early user feedback.</p><h3>KINDERGARTEN USERS</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> An emergency plan example </li><li> The ability for one user to create and update plans for the same school at many different locations </li></ul> <h3>STATE USERS</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> The delete button, associated with each record, removed from the dashboard; left on secondary individual record pages. </li></ul> <h3>ALL USERS</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> The ability to update and change info on their user accounts. </li></ul> <h3>ADDITIONAL FEATURES NEEDED </h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> Add maps once data becomes available </li><li> Create an overview dashboard to be used during disasters </li></ul> <p>If you visit this gallery, you'll see the middle of the road prototypes. Not the final solution, but I was very close to it. </p><h3>VALIDATE</h3> <h4 class="subheading">User Testing, Stakeholder Validations, Tech Capacity</h4> <p>First, we needed the approval of our major stakeholders - ChildCare Aware, Division of ChildCare, and our director. Then, we could proceed with user testing and user surveys. The most fun part during this stage was watching kindergarten teachers use the application, while uninterrupted. I knew I made it. Yupiiii</p><h3>Methods</h3> <ul class="content"> <div class="item"> <li class="title"> User Surveys</li></div><div class="item"> <li class="title"> Live Testing</li></div><div class="item"> <li class="title"> Field Visits</li></div><div class="item"> <li class="title"> Observations</li></div><div class="item"> <li class="title"> Random Testing</li></div></ul> <h3>Metrics</h3> <ul class="content"> <div class="item"> <li class="title"> Is it easy to use?</li></div><div class="item"> <li class="title"> Is it useful?</li></div><div class="item"> <li class="title"> Is it reassuring?</li></div></ul> <h3>Success </h3> <p>Since I found the way to avoid our common tech pitfalls, the usability testing (functionalities) was successful from the get go. I still had to deal with a negative cloud and positive cloud judgment. User onboarding and demos helped with removing the negative cloud judgment. Verbal feedback from the users was overall positive, but that didn’t convince me that I succeeded. Observations helped me assess that. While watching users navigate the application and across the interfaces, I realized that their level of understanding was complete. <p> </div></div></section> <section class="list section "> <div class="section-inner"> <div class="text-center"><a href="livestrongymca"><h3 >MORE DESIGN THINKING...</h3><h3>YMCA free programs</h3></a></div></div></section> <div class="footer-border"/> <footer class="footer col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-center"> <p class="copyright"> <a href="workhistory">EXPERIENCE</a> </p><p class="copyright">Designed and developed by Tanja Medic.</p><p class="copyright"> <a href="sitemap">Sitemap</a> </p></footer> <script type="text/javascript " src="assets/js/combined.js "></script> <script type="text/javascript " src="assets/js/creative.js "></script> <script type="text/javascript " src="assets/js/main.js "></script> <script type="text/javascript " src="assets/js/cssrefresh.js "></script> <script>/*=======Defer Image Loading *=======*/ function init(){var imgDefer=document.getElementsByTagName('img'); for (var i=0; i < imgDefer.length; i++){if (imgDefer[i].getAttribute('data-src')){imgDefer[i].setAttribute('src', imgDefer[i].getAttribute('data-src'));}}}window.onload=init; </script></body></html>
