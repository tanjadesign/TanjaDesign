2017)</span> </h4> <h2 class="panel-title"> ChildSafe</h2> <p>Designed and developed a Web-based application for emergency plans and three types of users: kindergartens, emergency management and state administrators.</p><h3>A little trivia</h3> <p>I come from a culture that cultivates straight and direct communication, and I appreciate when people openly express their emotions. That's why I listened when emergency managers consistently complained about emergency plans.</p><h3>Problem 1</h3> <p>According to the law, kindergartens have to submit emergency plans to the emergency management. They would send them by mail, or deliver them in person. Sometimes their plans were handwritten.</p><p>But the intent of the law - to help kindergartens better prepare for emergencies, better account for children’s safety, and better communicate with the local emergency management agency - was not fulfilled.</p><h3>Problem 2</h3> <p>The local agency was obliged to accept the plans and store them in an archive. However, they couldn’t use the details when they deploy during emergencies, and having access to these details can make a difference between life and death.</p><p>Their frustration was also tied to their inability to purse their larger strategic goal. During disasters, the agency is supposed to help with coordinating efforts on the ground and that includes providing accurate information to first responders.</p><p>For instance, if we have an emergency in the zip codes 40205 and 40207, knowing emergency details would help with deciding what kind of resources are needed on the ground - ambulances, fire trucks, people, etc. It could also help with planning for future emergencies.</p><h3>Problem 3</h3> <p>State administrators also had a problem on their hands. In order to issue kindergarten licenses, child care administrators had to check if kindergartens complied with the law. To accomplish that, they had to come to the archive room and sift through emergency plans. This was not their only responsibility. It was one of many. </p><h3>Problems Solved</h3> <p>So this simple application was a win-win for everyone involved. </p><p>Kindergartens and preschools can now create and make changes to their emergency plans whenever they want. They are not tied to any place, time, or a particular device.</p><p>Emergency managers can view information that can help with preventing injuries, saving lives and reuniting parents with their children. They can do that quickly and easily. They are also not tied to any place, time or a device.</p><p>State administrators can easily check if kindergartens comply with the law, and concentrate on much more important business.</p><p>Parents can also easily get the copies of emergency plans whenever they ask for it.</p><h3>Lesson</h3> <p>As they say, it's not what you know, but what you do with what you know.</p><p>In this case, users didn’t have to deal with cumbersome technology that causes frustration and anxiety. I knew I didn’t have any control over distractions in their work environment. I knew I couldn’t reduce the level of their work related stress. But I did everything I could to make their experience seamless and worthwhile.</p><p>In this case, I didn't worry about compliance; I worried about the outcome. That's how human-centered design looks like when applied to real problems. That's how essentially technology should be used - to solve problems, help users accomplish their tasks and get the outcome they need.</p><p>It is not invented, so that designers, developers and IT people can put themselves on a pedestal and bore and intimidate users with their IT jargon.</p><h3>ChildSafe Workflow</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> Recognized the problem and initiated a solution; performed the initial research; identified relevant stakeholders, user groups and business needs. </li><li> Collaborated with an emergency plan coordinator, ChildCare Aware, and the Division of Regulated Child Care when collecting requirements and implementing the solution. </li><li> Identified technology constraints; researched available development tools with special regard to security and data protection. </li><li> Pitched the idea to the higher-ups to get the approval and funding for the development tools. </li><li> Defined the scope, strategy, focus and user testing methods; proceeded with collecting information, planning and development. </li><li> Designed the user workflow and information architecture, performed user testing and created an optimal user experience for mobile, tablet and desktop devices before going public. </li><li> Developed a promo Web site to urge childcare providers to sign up and submit emergency plans. </li><li> Led user onboarding sessions. </li><li> Made final changes so that users can take the full ownership of the application and make easy changes to their user accounts. </li></ul> <h2> ENews</h2> <p>Designed and developed two responsive e-newsletter templates. One newsletter was used to send monthly safety tips to subscribers; another one to send work related updates to employees. </p><h3>Problem 1</h3> <p>The emergency management agency has the responsibility to educate the public about disaster preparedness and offer easily accessible safety tips. We already had related info stacked up on our Web page, but many complained that it was hard to find our Web page and that we don’t do enough to make it accessible.</p><p>In April of 2015, a lot of people affected by the flood signed up for information related to FEMA reimbursement. After I was done with sending flood related information to subscribers, I used the opportunity to offer monthly safety tips. I knew that a monthly newsletter wouldn’t entirely solve our problem, but at least, we were making an effort.</p><h3>Problem 2</h3> <p>I found out that our e-newsletter platform doesn’t have a mobile responsive template, and most of our subscribers signed up on mobile phones.</p><h3>Problems Solved</h3> <p>I designed and developed a mobile responsive template and worked with gov.delivery to make adjustments. I was disappointed a little because the end result didn’t work well with all e-mail clients, but I didn’t dwell on it. Back in the day, I created e-newsletters, and I knew about compatibility issues.</p><p>I was satisfied with the look and feel and overall functionality, and I knew I met my goal.</p><h3>Lesson</h3> <p>Do your best, and let go of the rest.</p><p>I initiated a monthly e-newsletter with the hope that others would soon contribute with the content, but that didn’t happen. Since I made the initiative, I had to suck it up and come up with new content every month.</p><p>Why? I thought it was important.</p><p>It is too late to offer safety tips during disasters. It seems irrelevant and cruel to offer safety tips after the disaster strikes, especially to people who are directly affected by it. And during training sessions, people get overwhelmed with too much information.</p><p>It sucked that no one really promoted the safety tips, and I never had a chance to do so. I also never had a chance to brainstorm about the content.</p><p>Here is one of the UX nuggets. Sometimes, stakeholders won’t tell you what they need. And reviewing tech and business needs won’t help you get to the heart of the issue.</p><p>When I created templates, I thought that we were facing tech constraints. In the end, it seemed we were facing staffing and talent issues.</p><p>How do you deal with that? How do you deal with situations you have no control over?</p><h3>ENewsletter Workflow</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> Reviewed our e-newsletter guidelines; identified tech constraints and benefits; reviewed litmus guidelines for responsive e-newsletter development. </li><li> Identified relevant stakeholders, users and business needs. </li><li> Defined design principles and focus; proceeded with sketching, prototyping, development, and revisions. </li><li> Collaborated with gov.delivery to adjust the template to their tech environment. </li><li> Reviewed litmus test; performed user testing; created the first full template version; validated with key stakeholders; launched the product. </li><li> Created content for the external e-newsletter once a month. </li></ul> <h2>WebEOC</h2> <p>Hired to administer emergency management system; ended up re-designing and re-developing the system and taking many roles throughout the project.</p><h3>Background</h3> <p>WebEOC is an online communication system intended for information sharing among 15 emergency groups during disasters. So when all hell breaks loose, everyone involved with emergency operations would log in and learn what is happening on the ground and what is needed.</p><p>It was also touted as a platform that would help administrators build customized interfaces on the fly during emergencies. When I took over, it was just a huge mess. It had no purpose and structure. Period.</p><h3>Problems</h3> <p>There were too many problems with the system, and I’ll just cite a few of them to shorten the story.</p><p>The system had 70 users, most of them sleepers, a few of them active. The system should only be used during big emergencies, but it was still worrisome that so many people didn’t sign up.</p><p>Horrible, horrible, horrible interface. I’ll spare you the details. I had never seen anything like it in my entire life. If I do see it in future, I’ll run away pronto. But you gather by now, that it was no accident that the system had only few users.</p><p>Bad programming. Jumpy interfaces. Unpredictable actions. Unnecessary JavaScript in the background. HTML was old. How old? Who knows? Some well known HTML tags such as links and buttons disabled, and replaced with proprietary tags. Inline CSS used on any page and throughout the system. Some JavaScript functions disabled; replaced with proprietary functions. No documentation and resources for proprietary tags. Too many pages. Too much code. That would all be OK, if the system had any development environment built into it. It didn’t. And I couldn’t copy the code files and build and test in a native environment too. So I had set my self with a nice never ending job.</p><h3>Solution</h3> <p>How did I solve all of that? By following the IT mantra - plan, design, build and test. And by pushing the walls. That’s how I felt most of the time, while trying to work through the issues.</p><p>The first hurdle was the hardest. I needed to find out about the structure of the system, its intended use, and users. The fog didn’t clear after reading their documents; they were intended for the outsiders. They didn’t explain about tasks needed to be accomplished during emergencies.</p><p>The fog didn’t clear after talking to vendors, IT people, emergency management and a whole bunch of other people.</p><p>So I gave the owners of the system two choices: either to stick with what the WebEOC vendor came up, or to customize the system based on their needs. In case they decided to proceed with the second choice - customization - they needed to be specific about their tasks and their needs. They chose to go with the vendor’s version, and agreed it was their job to explain about emergency operations to users.</p><p>I decided about the structure and design, and proceeded with building it, page by page. This involved hours and hours of work, cleaning and deciding what to keep, or fix. I swear after so many hours of sifting through the code, I forgot to talk. In any language.</p><p>In the end, the system was in a much better shape than before. It had clean, simple, and functional interfaces, and clear purpose.</p><p>The system gained new users. The number climbed to about 400 users.</p><p>However, the system still relied on a faulty WebEOC framework and that pretty much tied my hands. I was very disappointed with the result of my hard work. Considering the time and effort I put in it, I realized, I could have developed a better and much more useful system on my own, even if I had started with a blank page. And no one does that these days. Everyone tries to speed up through their development phase and automate as many tasks as possible.</p><h3>Lesson</h3> <p>Don’t try to put a lipstick on a pig. You’re still going to end up with a big, fat, and ugly pig. Put your users first, figure out what they want, and figure out how you’re going to accomplish your goal. In the end, it will all serve a purpose no matter what kind of obstacles you come across.</p><p>Also, don’t pay attention to naysayers. Ever. If you try to prove them wrong, you may end up doing what you didn’t want in the first place.</p><h3>WebEOC Workflow</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> Defined needs, benefits, technical analysis and design of a crisis management system. </li><li> Gathered and reviewed business requirements with users; discussed and analyzed problems users have with the production system; developed solutions, tested, and documented changes. </li><li> Designed and developed new system interfaces; created user guides; defined the sign up process. </li><li> Cooperated with vendors, IT services and other stakeholders to ensure usability and functionality. </li><li> Administered the emergency management system and provided user support. </li></ul> <h2>SharePoint</h2> <p>Developed two SharePoint applications for the quality assurance team and four types of users: performance reviewers, dispatchers and call takers, supervisors, and management.</p><h3>Problem</h3> <p>The quality assurance team had full hands with training employees, and monitoring the performance of 911 call takers and dispatchers. Almost everything was done on paper. They needed internal applications to replace some of their tedious paperwork.</p><h3>Solution</h3> <p>We turned to SharePoint; it was our only available resource at the time. The applications worked pretty good for them. I implemented workflows, so that each user can trigger the next task automatically.</p><p>The ladies knew what they wanted and how to ask for it. They maintained their database independently. Working with them was a breeze. I only had to jump in when we had sporadic interruptions in service.</p><h3>Lesson</h3> <p>There is no lesson here. We can’t really choose our users.</p><h3>SharePoint Workflow</h3> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> Gathered and reviewed business requirements with users.</li><li> Designed and developed new applications for four types of users; tested, and documented changes. </li><li> Defined permissions based on a user's need to know. </li><li> Imported applications into SharePoint to collect and store data in databases. </li><li> Implemented SharePoint workflows to to track the status, and collect signatures, feedback, and approval from users. </li><li> Created user guides; documented the process. </li></ul> <h2> Misc.</h2> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> Developed Web pages; created graphics, animations, reports, flyers, etc. </li><li> Updated and maintained five public-facing Web sites; created the initial content for all Web sites; developed layouts and designs based on the Bootstrap framework. </li></ul> </div><div class="item row" id="ge"> <h4> <span class="place">General Electric</span> <span class="year">(2012 - 2013)</span> </h4> <h3>Line Art, Illustrations, User Guides, Layout, Design</h3> <p>GE offers really cool black&white guides to its customers, with step-by-step illustrated installation and assembly instructions. I created line art, layout and design for these multi-lingual guides. I also updated wire diagrams occasionally.</p><p>Most of my work was deadline driven. Projects were called - Mission 1. Sounds so serious. Right? However, their deadlines were never unreasonable. GE had a really good project pipeline and workflow organization. </p><p>What is line art? Think about drawing. When you want to draw an object, you take a pencil or a pen and first draw lines based on your perspective.</p><p>In my case, I used Adobe Illustrator and its tool set. I drew washing machines, refrigerators, wires, screws, screwdrivers, hands, and anything in between, in order to help users install and assemble their product in sequence.</p><p>It requires concentration to details, and quick and creative thinking. Users don’t care if your illustration is cool or not, they just want to get their boring work done. So if you need to get rid of lines or change a perspective, you better do it, even if you have spent a few hours drawing those lines. Your job is to help them accomplish their task. Pronto.</p></div><div class="item row" id="kinetic"> <h4> <span class="place">Kinetic.theTechnologyAgency</span> <span class="year">(2011 - 2012)</span> </h4> <h3>Proofing, Layout, Technical Documents, Translation Software</h3> <p>Kinetic built a custom software solution for translating tech documents to foreign languages. I prepared tech documents for translation projects.</p><p>I ended up being the deadline person. And I ended up proofing the work of other employees and providing feedback to them.</p><p>The job required attention to details, details, details, and eye strain <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> Seriously. We would get messed up files and we would piece them together. It required inventiveness in a way. Sometimes the problems were invisible to the eye and we needed to figure out the right solution.</p></div><div class="item row" id="jfcs"> <h4> <span class="place">JFCS</span> <span class="year">(2010 - 2011)</span> </h4> <h3>Farmers Market, Micro Enterprise, E-newsletters</h3> <p>JFCS started a farmers market & bazaar to help refugees, enrolled in their micro-enterprise program, overcome their challenges. During the summer, I joined to help with marketing and tech assistance. </p><p>The biggest challenge was low visitation, with no budget for promotion. So what did I do? A little bit of everything. If I could have stand on my head, I probably would have.</p><p> On Sundays, I would be on the market helping with coordination. During the week, I would come out blazing, handing out flyers, giving presentations, talking to small business owners, community activists, and media. Media with their sorry and stereotypical stories about refugees didn’t help our cause. Except, The Highlander. They really helped by recommending our market to its readers.</p><p>What was successful? A weekly e-newsletter. I hand coded the newsletter, stored the template on their drive, and sent the new copies every Friday at noon via Outlook. I would write stories about vendors and include the most important facts about our market. Majority of our subscribers shared the newsletter with their connections.</p><p>It was a really neat idea. On the surface, it looked like we were joining a buy local and grow local movement in Louisville. Below the surface, this market was addressing the larger problem. To start a business, you need a credit history and savings. Newcomers to this country had none.</p><p>As with any new idea, it takes time to make the inroads. However, non-profits solely shouldn’t bear the burden of initiating programs like this. They have a bigger fish to fry.</p><p>If we are serious about community building, then these kind of efforts should be community supported. And they should only be used as a jumping board for refugees, so they can later fly on their own.</p></div><div class="item row"> <hr class="divider"/> <h3>Web Designer </h3> <hr class="divider"/> <h3>Graphic Designer </h3> <hr class="divider"/> <h3>Business Analyst </h3> <hr class="divider"/> </div></section> <section class="languages section" id="languages"> <div class="section-inner"> <h2 class="heading">Languages</h2> <div class="content "> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li class="item"> <span class="title">English</span> <li class="item"> <span class="title">Bosnian</span> </div></div></section> <section class="testimonials section" id="testimonials"> <h2 class="heading">Testimonials</h2> <div class="item"> <blockquote class="quote"> <p> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>I would recommend Tanja to any company that is looking to create a unique user experience...</p></blockquote> <blockquote class="source"> <span class="name">Jessica Brooks </span> </blockquote> </div><div class="item"> <blockquote class="quote"> <p> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> She has not only impressed technical team members, but also earned the respect of all other teams in the organization...</p></blockquote> <blockquote class="source"> <span class="name">Himanshu Shah </span> </blockquote> </div><div class="item"> <blockquote class="quote"> <p> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>Tanja has a strong drive and curiosity to really understand why she's designing something, which ultimately results in a user experience and artwork that exceeds expectations...</p></blockquote> <blockquote class="source"> <span class="name">Keith Thomas</span> </blockquote> </div></section> <section class="list section"> <nav aria-label="..."> <ul class="pager inline"> <li class="previous"> <a href="design_thinking">My Process</a> </li><li class="next"><a href="ui">Web Sites</a></li></ul> </nav> </section></div></div><div class="footer-border"/> <footer class="footer col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-center"> <img class="img-responsive magic" src="data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" data-src="assets/images/magichat.png" alt=alt="magic hat inside the store with stars coming out and going to the top"/> <div class="container"> <div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-4 col-md-4 col-md-offset-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-center"> <p class="copyright">Designed and developed by Tanja Medic.</p><p class="copyright"> <a href="sitemap">Sitemap</a> </p></div></div></footer> <script type="text/javascript " src="assets/js/combined.js "></script><script type="text/javascript " src="assets/js/creative.js "></script><script type="text/javascript " src="assets/js/main.js "></script><script type="text/javascript " src="assets/js/cssrefresh.js "></script><script>/*=======Defer Image Loading *=======*/ function init(){var imgDefer=document.getElementsByTagName('img'); for (var i=0; i < imgDefer.length; i++){if (imgDefer[i].getAttribute('data-src')){imgDefer[i].setAttribute('src', imgDefer[i].getAttribute('data-src'));}}}window.onload=init;</script></body></html>
